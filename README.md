# Equifax Data Breach: Technical Analysis and Strategic Cybersecurity Recommendations

## Overview
This project presents an in-depth technical analysis of the 2017 Equifax data breach. It dissects the root causes, examines the cascading failures within the security architecture, and quantifies the breach’s financial and reputational impact. Key vulnerabilities analyzed include the exploitation of an unpatched Apache Struts vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638), insufficient data encryption protocols, and inadequate network segmentation that allowed lateral movement within the compromised environment.

## Project Objectives
- **Technical Analysis:** Examine the primary vulnerabilities and systemic failures that led to the breach.
- **Case Study Development:** Use advanced cybersecurity methodologies—including vulnerability management, SIEM-based threat detection, and incident response tactics—to assess the incident.
- **Strategic Recommendations:** Provide actionable remediation strategies focusing on:
  - **Patch Management Automation:** Implementing automated patch deployment to reduce exposure time.
  - **Network Segmentation and Micro-Segmentation:** Redefining access controls to contain breaches.
  - **Advanced Incident Response:** Deploying playbooks for rapid threat containment, deception technologies, and behavioral analytics for enhanced detection.

## Environment
- **Test Bed:** A controlled environment using virtual machines to simulate enterprise systems.
- **Tools & Technologies:** Apache Struts, SIEM solutions, vulnerability scanners, and custom incident response playbooks.
