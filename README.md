## Introduction
This project explores one of the most significant data breaches in history: the 2017 Equifax incident. By dissecting how the breach occurred and what vulnerabilities were exploited, we aim to provide insights into effective cybersecurity strategies and preventive measures.

## Attack Category Overview
The breach primarily resulted from the exploitation of an unpatched vulnerability in Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638). This section reviews:
- Common attack vectors and techniques.
- Industry statistics on similar exploitation methods.

## Company and Incident Summary
- **Company:** Equifax, a major credit reporting agency.
- **Breach Summary:** Exploitation of a known vulnerability exposed personal data for approximately 147 million individuals.
- **Data Compromised:** Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, and more.

## Timeline of Events
- **March 2017:** Discovery of the Apache Struts vulnerability.
- **May 2017:** Initiation of the exploitation by attackers.
- **July 2017:** Breach detected by Equifax.
- **September 2017:** Public disclosure of the breach.

## Vulnerabilities Identified
- **Unpatched Apache Struts Vulnerability:** Failure to apply timely patches allowed exploitation.
- **Inadequate Network Segmentation:** Enabled lateral movement within the network.
- **Weak Monitoring and Detection:** Delayed detection prolonged attacker access.
- **Insufficient Incident Response:** The breach response was slow, exacerbating the impact.

## Impact and Costs
- **Financial:** Over $1.4 billion in settlements, fines, and legal fees.
- **Reputational:** Significant loss of consumer trust and intense media scrutiny.
- **Operational:** Substantial costs for IT infrastructure upgrades and enhanced monitoring.

## Prevention and Remediation Recommendations
- **Patch Management Automation:** Deploy automated patching systems to reduce exposure.
- **Enhanced Monitoring and Detection:** Utilize SIEM solutions and behavioral analytics to detect anomalies.
- **Improved Incident Response:** Regularly test and update response plans with tailored playbooks.
- **Network Segmentation:** Reinforce isolation between systems to prevent lateral movement.

## Technical Analysis and Strategic Recommendations
This section details our comprehensive technical analysis:
- **Case Study Development:** Utilizing advanced methodologies such as vulnerability scanning, SIEM-based threat detection, and incident response drills.
- **Strategic Recommendations:** Actionable steps including patch management automation, network segmentation strategies, and rapid incident containment measures using deception technologies and zero-trust principles.

## Environment and Tools
- **Test Bed:** A controlled environment using virtual machines to simulate enterprise systems.
- **Tools & Technologies:** Apache Struts, SIEM solutions, vulnerability scanners, and custom incident response playbooks.
